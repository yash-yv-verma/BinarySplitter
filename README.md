# Binary Splitter and Editor

This tool splits large binary files into smaller chunks, edit specific portions of those chunks by directly modifying the binary data, and then merge the edited chunks back into a single binary file. Itâ€™s particularly useful for tasks that involve manipulating binary data at a low level, such as modifying firmware files, binary data structures, or any other binary file where precise control over the data is required.
